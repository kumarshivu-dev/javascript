# History of JavaScript

## 1995: The Birth of JavaScript

- **Static Web Pages**:
  - Early web pages were static. Any user interaction (e.g., calculations or form validation) required sending a request to the server.
  - The server would process the input and respond with a new HTML page, resulting in a slow, clunky user experience.
- **Solution**:
  - Brendan Eich developed JavaScript in just **10 days** at **Netscape Communications Corporation**.
- **Naming Evolution**:
  - Initially called **Mocha**.
  - Renamed to **LiveScript**.
  - Finally named **JavaScript** to leverage the growing popularity of Java (despite the two being unrelated).
- **Purpose**:
  - Designed as a lightweight, interpreted scripting language to run directly in the browser. - Enabled dynamic interactions like input validation and animations without needing to reload the page.

## 1996: Microsoft Enters the Scene

- **JScript**:
  - Seeing JavaScript's potential, Microsoft created its own implementation, called **JScript**.
  - Shipped with **Internet Explorer 3.0** in 1996.
- **Browser Wars**:
  - Netscape and Microsoft extended JavaScript in their own ways, causing fragmentation.
  - Developers faced challenges writing cross-browser-compatible code.

## 1997: Standardization of JavaScript

- **Compatibility Issues**:
  - Developers had to write different code for different browsers, making web development more complex.
- **ECMAScript Standard**:
  - JavaScript was standardized by **ECMA International** as **ECMAScript** in 1997.
  - Provided a consistent language core for all browsers.

## 2008: The V8 Engine and JIT Compilation

- **Google Chrome**:
  - Google released **Chrome** in 2008, introducing the **V8 JavaScript engine**.
- **JIT Compilation**:
  - **V8** could compile JavaScript into **machine code** for faster execution.
  - **Just-In-Time (JIT) Compilation**:
    - Compiles JavaScript code into machine code at runtime instead of interpreting it line by line.
    - Transformed JavaScript into a high-performance language suitable for large-scale applications.
